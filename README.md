# Predicting-Diabetes-using-a-Decision-Tree-Classifier
This repository contains a Python implementation of a system for predicting diabetes using a decision tree classifier. The system is based on the Pima Indians Diabetes dataset, which is a publicly available dataset of diabetes data.
The system is implemented using the following Python libraries: Pandas, NumPy, Scikit-learn, Seaborn, and, Graphviz.
The system is tested using the holdout method, where 30% of the data is used for testing and the remaining 70% is used for training. The system achieves an accuracy of 77.78% on the test set.
To use the system, you can simply run the main.py script. The script will read the diabetes dataset and train a decision tree classifier. The classifier will then be used to predict the diabetes status of the test data.
The system is still under development, but it is already able to predict diabetes with a high degree of accuracy. I plan to add more features to the system, such as the ability to predict the severity of diabetes.
